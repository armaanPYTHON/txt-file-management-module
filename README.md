# txt-file-management-module
This is a simple yet VERY useful module that I have created to simply manage data in text or dat files for your code. All you need to do is download this file and import it in your code.


In most of my codes at least i save data of the user using simple text or dat files. They are easier to use than a database and much more safer too.
Although saving, deleting or reading data each time can be really messy and confusing.
Hence this module can be easily used to perform those tasks.


The available tasks are:
1. Delete an object
2. Read each line and convert to a list (each line is one item in the list)
3. Read the entire document and return a string
4. Delete all the objects from the provided list in the main file
5. Add an object
6. Add all the objects from a provided list in the main file


To use this module, just follow me, like this repository and download the txtopp.py file to the directory you want.
In the code you want to import this module write:
import txtopp



Thank you!
